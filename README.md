# Introduction

Welcome to the open-source project, **Octops**!

# About the Game

The game consists of different screens based on Counter Strike 1.6 theme. There's a map which gives access to different locations. Each screen presents players with a distinct challenge or mission. To succeed, players must solve puzzles, and apply their skills effectively. Once all the tasks are accomplished, players gain access to the bomb and must defuse it to win the round.


# File Structure

The project is structured into several folders and files:

### 1. **assets/**

The `assets/` directory is intended for storing assets such as images, fonts, audio, and other resources that your application may need. These assets can be accessed within your Kivy files.

Example:
- `assets/main_logo.png`

### 2. **screen_layout/**

The `screen_layout/` directory contains the Kivy language (KV) files that define the structure and appearance of the app's screens and their layouts. These KV files are connected to their respective screens in the `screens/` folder using `Builder.load_file()`.

Example:
- `screen_layout/main_screen.kv`
- `screen_layout/map_screen.kv`

### 3. **screens/**

The `screens/` directory is intended for Python files that define the behavior and logic of individual screens within your application. These screens are managed and coordinated using Kivy's `ScreenManager` in the main Python file.

Example:
- `screens/main_screen.py`
- `screens/map_screen.py`

### 4. **octops.py**

`octops.py` is the main Python script that acts as the entry point of your Kivy application. It connects and manages all the components of your application, including screens, transitions, and user interactions. This script initializes the Kivy app and sets up the screen manager.

Example:
- `octops.py`

## How It Works

1. The `octops.py` script is the entry point of the application. It initializes the Kivy app and sets up the screen manager.

2. The KV files in the `screen_layout/` directory define the layout and appearance of the screens and widgets.

3. The Python files in the `screens/` directory define the behavior and logic of individual screens. These screens are connected to the corresponding KV files.

4. The `ScreenManager` in `octops.py` manages transitions between different screens based on user interactions or application logic.

## Getting Started

To run the Octops Kivy app on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Afterdie/octops-final
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies if you haven't already. You may use a virtual environment for this:

   ```sh
   pip install kivy
   ```

3. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```sh
   cd octops-final
   ```

4. Run the application:

   ```sh
   python octops.py
   ```

The app should launch, and you can interact with it to explore its functionality.
